This was a website i creacted while I studied in class 10, today I am doing B.tech. 
The folder which used to contain the website reated domceumnts such as image and video are gone or deleted. 
If I am again intersted in the same code, i would use it. 

If you have free time, you can excavate the css used in pic format within gallery section and other section.
It might hold a unique sturcture which was for me while I was studing back then and is also amazing now. 
I will be glad to use the same style of pic arrangement which some arrange in upcoming project too.
