     Kirtipur (Nepali: कीर्तिपुर, Nepal Bhasa: किपू Kipoo) is an ancient city of Nepal. It is located in the Kathmandu Valley 5 km south-west of the city of Kathmandu. It is one of the five municipalities in the valley, the others being Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur and Madhyapur Thimi. It is one of the most famous and religious places to visit. Many people visit this place to not only to see the beauty of nature but also to visit temples. The city was listed as a UNESCO tentative site in 2008.

     	<h2>Etymology</h2>

     <p> The name Kirtipur comes from the Sanskrit terms Kirti (glory) and pur (city). The colloquial term used for the city is Kipoo.</p>
     Originally a Newar foundation, Kirtipur is still a center of Newar culture. It has been merged with surrounding villages to form the municipality of Kirtipur with a population of 67,171. southern Part of Kirtipur is surrounded by ChampaDevi Hill. On Nepali new Year (Bishak 1) people around kathmandu Valley hike up to the Hill.

     It has many temples, gumbas (Buddhist monasteries) and churches. Due to the presence of Tribhuvan University, Kirtipur is a popular area for out-of-town students and professors to rent houses and they are major contributors to the local economy.
     <p>
     	<h2> History</h2>
     	Kirtipur's history dates from 1099 A.D. It was part of the territory of Lalitpur at the time of the invasion of the Kathmandu Valley by the Gorkhali king Prithvi Narayan Shah in the 18th century.<br>

        In 1767, Kirtipur was annexed to the Gorkhali kingdom by Prithvi Narayan Shah following the Battle of Kirtipur. He conquered the town on his third attempt, after entering it by trickery. After this, he cut off the noses of the people (both male and female) over 13 years of age in the city.

        This was the site of an inspirational peaceful demonstration of the people in the 2006 mass uprising that overthrew the powers of the king. It is considered to be an anti-monarchy city due to its bitter history against the Shah dynasty whose modern founder conquered the city insultingly, which was followed by negligence of the administration and development by subsequent rulers.
